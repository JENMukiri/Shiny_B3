# Assignments STAT545:B3

## Overview
This is assginment B-3 for the STAT 545B Class *[STAT 545B_3](https://stat545.stat.ubc.ca/assignments/assignment-b3/)*. 

The objective is to learn how to building dashboards using key R function; `shiny`. 

I opted to **Option A - BC Liqour App**

This built on the already existing BC liquor app included task:

- [x] Shiny app development: *Option A*
  * There’s at least one new functional widget that modifies at least one output. 
  * There’s at least one change to the UI (aside from the addition of a widget).
  * A third feature, whether it’s a change to the UI, or a functional widget. 

- [x] RRR
  * Code runs without errors and it is appropriately annotated, legible, and easy to follow
  * Your app should be deployed online

- [x] Tidy Submission :
  * Readme
  * Description 
  * Tag release

## App description
This app allows you to access the BC liquor app database and download data into a csv. The app is different from the original.Key distinctions are:
 1. Tab layout for viewing the graph and tables and addition of logo
 2. Option to download data based on options selected 
 3. Visualizing the histogram based on sub-type of beverage
 4. Being able to reset the app
 
 Based on these changes this app is user friendly compared to the original version.
 
 **Data** : For this assignment data was sourced from here: [BC Liquor data](https://deanattali.com/files/bcl-data.csv) that was sourced from [Opendata_bc](https://www.opendatabc.ca/dataset/bc-liquor-store-product-price-list-current-prices)
  
## Project Folder/Files

* *[R code script](/app.R)*: This is where we the shiny app code lies

* *[R project file](/B_3_Ass.Rproj)* : where R stores the project into its own working directorty, workspace , history and source of documents

* *[README.md](/README.md)* : read me file for this repo

## Code execution
 `R` software along with additional packages such as `testthat`, `tidyverse`, `roxygen2`, `shiny` were used. 
 IDE -`RStudio` carried out the task.
