## Overview
This is assginment B-3 for the STAT 545B Class *[STAT 545B_3](https://stat545.stat.ubc.ca/assignments/assignment-b3/)*. 

The objective is to learn how to building dashboards using key R function; `shiny`. 

I opted to **Option A - BC Liqour App**

This built on the already existing BC liquor app included task:

- [x] Shiny app development: *Option A*
  * There’s at least one new functional widget that modifies at least one output. 
  * There’s at least one change to the UI (aside from the addition of a widget).
  * A third feature, whether it’s a change to the UI, or a functional widget. 

- [x] RRR
  * Code runs without errors and it is appropriately annotated, legible, and easy to follow
  * Your app should be deployed online

- [x] Tidy Submission :
  * Readme
  * Description 
  * Tag release
